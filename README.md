## Pairwise Sequence aligner that uses the local alignment algorithm to align two sequences from one FASTA file.

This is a program that aligns two sequences from one fasta file using the pairwise local alignment algorithm

## Requirements
*python 3.x
*BioPython
*argparse module

## Installation

Clone the repository:

```

git clone TwoSeqAlignment

```

Change directory into repository:

```

cd TwoSeqAlignment

```

## Usage
